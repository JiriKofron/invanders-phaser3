# Space Invaders Game - Phaser3
Space Invaders

Welcome to the Space Invaders game! This project is my first attempt at creating a game using the Phaser 3 game development framework. I am excited to share this project and eager to continue learning and improving my game development skills.

# Game Description
Space Invaders is a classic arcade-style game where you control a spaceship to defend the Earth against an invading alien horde. The invaders move in a formation and gradually descend towards the bottom of the screen. Your mission is to shoot down the invaders while avoiding their attacks. Be careful not to let the invaders reach the bottom, and try to eliminate all of them to achieve victory!

# Gameplay Instructions
- Use the Left Arrow key to move your spaceship to the left.
- Use the Right Arrow key to move your spaceship to the right.
- Press the Spacebar to shoot laser bullets at the invaders.
- Your spaceship can only shoot one bullet at a time.
- Your goal is to destroy all the invaders before they reach the bottom of the screen.

# Installation
To run the game locally, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Make sure you have Node.js installed.
- Open a terminal and navigate to the cloned repository's directory.
- Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.
- Run npm start to start the development server.
- Open a web browser and navigate to localhost server to play the game.

# Technologies Used
Phaser 3: A powerful game development framework used for creating 2D games in JavaScript.
Howler: A JavaScript audio library used to manage and play game sounds.

# Future Plans
As my first Phaser 3 project, I'm proud of what I've accomplished with this Space Invaders game. I'm excited to continue exploring game development and learning more about creating engaging gameplay, adding new features, and refining my skills. Stay tuned for more updates and projects in the future!

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, and enjoy playing Space Invaders!
